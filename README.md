## Hi, I'm Gustavo 

### About me:
I am a Systems Analysis and Development undergraduate at Feevale (Brazil). <br />
Working as a Front-end Developer.

I have fun writing code and that's what keeps my motivation high. I love creating new projects and I feel great when I try to recreate something that I like to use.

If you want, you can check out my personal projects in my âœ¨[Portfolio](https://portfolio.gustavocarvalho.dev.br/)âœ¨
